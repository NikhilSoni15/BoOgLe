# BoOgLe
A web search engine


Hi Welcome to BoOgL! A simple yet effefctive Web search engine made by me based on old google reserach papers/ Ths Repo contains 3 sections:

1) A web Scraper to get all your webpages ready to be indexed by the indexer.
2) An indexer to build an inverted index for your query processor.
3) A query proessor to run queries and get results in realtime

Every Section has a complete readme file to help set it up along with explained working!
